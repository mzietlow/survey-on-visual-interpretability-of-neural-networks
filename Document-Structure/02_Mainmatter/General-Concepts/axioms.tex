\subsection{Axioms}
Following the terminology of~\cite{Sundararajan.2017}, axioms describe desirable properties which a method should satisfy.

\subsubsection{Selectivity/Fidelity}
`Put another way, a method with high fidelity will assign high relevance to features that, when removed, greatly reduce the DNNâ€™s output confidence in the class assignment, while assigning low relevance to features that do not greatly affect the confidence when removed. Fidelity cannot be established axiomatically, and so must be estimated using implementations of the explanation method with the DNN model and dataset under investigation.'\cite{Tomsett.2019} Also look up: \citeauthor{Bach.2015, AlvarezMelis.2018}.
