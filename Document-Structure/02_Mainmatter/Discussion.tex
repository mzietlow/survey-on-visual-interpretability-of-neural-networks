\section{Conclusion}
Interpretability of \glspl{nn} is a necessity for various reasons. This paper summarized multiple methods, that aim to visualize these explanations. Since first methods were introduced in \cite{RobnikSikonja.2008} many new approaches have evolved. Some of the most promising methods like \gls{cem} or \todo{was sind denn die interessantesteten sahcxen bei dir?} have found new, but much more interpretable ways of explaining \glspl{nn}. 
\par
Even though there still is no favorable method at this time and for most approaches much more research is necessary, there are more ways than ever to visualize \glspl{nn} in an understandable way.

\section{Future Research}
There have been many new approaches towards Perturbation-Based Methods in the last years. Methods like anchors or \gls{cem} are promising, but need more research in order to refine them and make them applicable to various types of data.
