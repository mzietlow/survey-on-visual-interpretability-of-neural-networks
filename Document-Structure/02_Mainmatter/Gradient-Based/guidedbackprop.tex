\subsection{Guided Backprop}\label{subsect:guided-backprop}
Guided Backpropagation as proposed by \fcite{Springenberg.2015} is a method for reproducing the \ref{itm:signal} that a \gls{nn} extracted from an input-sample \(x\).
It builds upon the deconvolutional-method, first proposed by \fcite{Zeiler.2014}.
