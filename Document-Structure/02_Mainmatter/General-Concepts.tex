\subsection{Mathematical Notation}
Among all works in this survey, only few stick to a unified mathematical notation. And if so, this is usually due to it being the same authors as in another work. In this survey, for Gradient-Based methods, the mathematical notation of \fcite{Bach.2015} is used for its simplicity. Usually when writing about datasets, input-samples, weights, and biases vector and matrix notation is required. \fcite{Bach.2015} omit all this. For a counterexample of a more matrix-centered notation, kindly refer to \fcite{Kindermans.2018}.
For mathematical notation this work builds upon the shoulders of~\cite{Kindermans.2018}
